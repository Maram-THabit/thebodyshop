            <h1><span>Social </span>Activism</h1>
            <h5>TheBodyShop</h5>
            <p>
                 has long-held aims of social activism as part of its business practices, first evidenced in 1986 when proposing an alliance with Greenpeace to save the whales.
                Roddick later began launching other promotions through the business tied to social causes, such as featuring posters in its stores and sponsoring local charity and community events.
                Over time, Roddick herself took on gradually more critical views of both wider business and the cosmetics industry in particular, criticising what she considered the environmental insensitivity of the industry and its traditional views of beauty, and aimed to change standard corporate practices through her business.
                Roddick stated that "For me, campaigning and good business is also about putting forward solutions, not just opposing destructive practices or human rights abuses".
                In 1997, Roddick launched a global campaign to raise self-esteem in women and against the media stereotyping of women. It focused on unreasonably thin models in the context of rising numbers in bulimia and anorexia.

            <h1><span>Policy </span>Animal Testing</h1>
            <h5>TheBodyShop</h5>
            <p>
                has campaigned to end animal testing in cosmetics alongside animal cruelty NGO Cruelty-Free International since 1989.
                The company's products are non-animal tested and are certified cruelty-free by Cruelty Free International’s Leaping Bunny.
                In June 2017, The Body Shop and Cruelty-Free International launched Forever Against Animal Testing, its largest ever campaign, aimed at banning animal testing in cosmetics everywhere and forever.
                By the end of 2018, the petition had reached 8.3 million signatures and was taken to the United Nations.
                In October 2009, The Body Shop was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by the RSPCA in Britain, in recognition of its uncompromised policy which ensures ingredients are not tested by its suppliers.
                In 2021, The Body Shop announced that all their products would be certified vegan by The Vegan Society as of the end of 2023.
                Currently, around 60% of the retailer's products are vegan.
